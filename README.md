# Project Name
> HousingPredictionModel

## Problem Statetment
* A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
- How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.
